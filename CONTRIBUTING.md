# Contributing

## Development

You need NodeJS >= 14.x.x

- Clone the repository.
- `cd ./haskell-spotlight`.
- See `Makefile`.
- Before publish a PR, please ensure that it builds without errors in production mode: `npm run build && npm start`.

If you want to implement some significant change, it's better to create a GitHub issue and discuss it first.

## Other ways to contribute

- Star ⭐️ the project on GitHub.
- Propose feature ideas.
- Report bugs.
- Follow and retweet us on Twitter: [@HaskellSpot](https://twitter.com/HaskellSpot).
- You can contribute by sponsoring the project or propose a job in a Haskell project to the [author](mailto:visotelle+haskell-spotlight@gmail.com). 🙂
- Any other way that will come to your mind.
